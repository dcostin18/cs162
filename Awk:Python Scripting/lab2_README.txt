Language: Awk and Python

Objective: This lab consisted of 2 parts, stated as follows:

report.awk:
Using awk to grok a mail server log: Provided with a log file from a mail server running the Postfix SMTP server, the Amavis mail filter, and the SpamAssassin SPAM filter, process the mail log using awk to produce a report with interesting statistics, such as top e-mail recipients, number of SPAM messages received, etc.

Note: I very much enjoyed this part of the project, since it used scripting (one of my favorite parts of programming) to extract useful information from a very large pool of data. 

distance.py:
Text distance: In natural language processing, two texts can be compared to determine how similar they are according to multiple criteria. In this exercise, we will simplify the definition of “distance” between two texts, in such a way that it will be possible to compute this distance using a Python script.
